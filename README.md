# Assembly Project for the Comp103 Module
[University Of Liverpool - Computer Science]
## Practical Session 3

A program in assembly language that will:
1. Read a number, n;
2. Go round a loop in which a further n numbers are read. When a strictly positive (i.e. > 0)
number is read, increase a variable poscount by 1; when a negative number is read, increase a
variable negcount by 1; and when zero is read, increase a variable zerocount by 1.
3. Write out the poscount, negcount and zerocount variables.
